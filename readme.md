# Wine Cellar Sample Application with Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap and require.js #

This [sample CRUD application](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar) was originally built by [ccoenraets] (https://github.com/ccoenraets).

I have forked it and added AMD support using [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/).
